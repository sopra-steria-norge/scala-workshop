Scala Koans
==========

# FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
Further development of the scala-koans can be had at https://bitbucket.org/dickwall/scala-koans/overview

## About the Scala Koans
Inspired by the Ruby koans, the Scala koans will guide you on your journey to learn Scala.

## How to start your journey

Run `sbt` or `sbt.bat` depending on your platform. Then in the shell run 'test-only org.scalakoans.Koans' and follow the steps.

Note: The `~koans` command used in the original version is not compatible with SBT 0.11 and therefore not configured at the moment.
